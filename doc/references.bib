abstract = {Many applications in computer graphics require complex, highly detailed models. However, the level of detail actually necessary may vary considerably. To control processing time, it is often desirable to use approximations in place of excessively detailed modelsWe have developed a surface simplification algorithm which can rapidly produce high quality approximations of polygonal models. The algorithm uses iterative contractions of vertex pairs to simplify models and maintains surface error approximations using quadric matrices. By contracting arbitrary vertex pairs (not just edges), our algorithm is able to join unconnected regions of models. This can facilitate much better approximations, both visually and with respect to geometric error. In order to allow topological joining, our system also supports non-manifold surface models.},

abstract = {Abstract We propose a new algorithm for automatically computing approximations of a given polyhedral object at different levels of details. The application for this algorithm is the display of very complex scenes. where many objects are seen with a range of varying levels of detail. Our approach is similar to the region-merging method used for image segmentation. We iteratively collapse edges, based on a measure of the geometric deviation from the initial shape. When edges are merged in the right order, this strategy produces a continuum of valid approximations of the original object, which can be used for faster rendering at vastly different scales.},
