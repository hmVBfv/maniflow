"""
The mesh optimisation is based on the minimisation of an energy function which rewards
a mesh being as close as possible to the initial points but penalises an increasing number of vertices.
It consists of the sum of
* E_dist, the sum of squared distances between the mesh and the points
* E_rep, a penaliser proportional to the amount of vertices used
* E_spring, a spring energy of rest length zero to ensure the existence of a minimum to the overall energy equation.
"""

"""
Since E_rep is depending on the amount of vertices and not their acutal positions,
optimiseVertexPos() is trying to minimise the sum E_dist + E_spring.
It uses projectPoints() and improveVertexPos().

Calculate the optimal barycentric coordinate vectors B for given fixed vertex positions V using projection
A naive approach as to project each point onto each of the faces might be too inefficient.

We apply the conjugate gradient method to solve the problems.

"""
To optimise the mesh structure we us three elementary transformations:
* edge collapse, eliminating an edge and identifying its endpoints with eachother
* edge split, introducing another vertex on the edge which in turn spawn new edges to vertices that are adjacent to both former endpoints.
* edge swap, the edge no connects vertices that are adjacent to both former endpoints instead of said former endpoints.
"""
def optimiseMesh():

"""
The operation of splitting an edge is inherently a valid move, as it never alters the topological structure of the mesh.
Conversely, the remaining two transformations possess the potential to modify the topological structure,
hence the need to check whether they can be applied.
We check whether an operation reduces the energy and is legal and decide accordingly.
* Edge splitting is always legal.
* The edge collapse between points i and j is legal if and only if all vertices k adjacent to i and j form faces {i,j,k} as well as
    ^ If i and j are boundary vertices, then the edge {i,j} is a boundary edge
    ^ If neither i nor j are boundary vertices, then the local mesh as at least four vertices
    ^ Otherwise, the local mesh has at least three vertices.
* An edge swap is only legal if and only if there exists no edge between the potential two new endpoints of the edge swap.
