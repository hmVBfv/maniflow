# Examples

In this folder you can find some .obj files to play around with and some
Jupyter Notebooks that showcase some capabilities of maniflow.

## Disclaimer
Sadly, the Jupyter Notebooks are not properly rendered in GitLab.
You might have to open them locally, using
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
or
````bash
python -m notebook
````
