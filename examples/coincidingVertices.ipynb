    "## The upper triangular approach\n",
    "The old version of `coincidingVertices` utilizes an approach with a time complexity of $O(n^2)$, where n represents the number of vertices in the mesh. While being naive in its concept there are a few tweaks that improve the algorithm, more than halving its runtime. It starts by initializing empty data structures, iterates through each vertex to detect coinciding vertices, merges them into a single vertex, and updates the mesh accordingly. To reduce computational power needed this naive approach is improved by the simple fact that if $a == b$ then also $b == a$, so this halves the amount of computations. This leaves us with an upper triangular form where we only have to check the following indices but not the previous as those where checked before. E.g. when checking whether the third vertex can be identified with another vertex we can start at the fourth vertex since, say, the check against the second vertex already happened when we previously check for identities with the second vertex. The resulting matrix looks similar to this\n",

    "Looking back, this approach is, in its core, equivalent to the bubblesort sorting algorithm. The simplified pseudocode of bubblesort with adjustments to highlight similarities proves this as it consists of the same two for loops as the upper triangle approach with an if-condition nested inside them. Bubblesort has the 'swapped'-flag to break early in case no swap occured during an iteration indicating that the elements are all sorted. A similar thing happens in the upper triangle approach with the use of the 'lookup'-list where we skip through the iteration of $i,j$ if a vertex was already coincided."

The same is true for the upper triangle approach as when all of the points lie close within the tolerance value then after one iteration we are done with only the initial first vertex left. Also, the worst-case scenario is the same that when bubblesort has to always change the positions of the elements checked and the upper triangle approach has to work through all possible vertex pairs as there is no coinciding, leaving the two with a performance of $O(n^2)$."

    "## Time to sort - Using Timsort to speed things up\n",
    "The updated version of `coincidingVertices` employs a more efficient approach compared to the old version. It starts by creating an empty list `extVertList` and copies the mesh's faces into `faceList`. It then iterates through each face and its vertices, adding the j-th vertex in the i-th face along with the information on i and j to `extVertList`. Next, it sorts `extVertList` by the first element (the vertex coordinates) using Python's Timsort algorithm, resulting in a stable sorting with an average time complexity of O(n log(n)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The function then initializes an empty list `vertList` and iterates through all entries of `extVertList`. For each entry `v`, it checks if `vertList` is empty or if the vertex is not close to the previous one. If so, it adds the vertex to `vertList`. Additionally, it updates the vertices in `faceList` based on the indices in `vertList`, ensuring that vertices with the same coordinates are identified and glued together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the definition of closeness is not the standard metric but whether the vertices can be fitted into a box of size *2\\*atol x 2\\*atol x 2\\*atol*. While not as intuitive as a simple distance between the points in the three dimensional, this allows us to use the a sorting algorithm since the vertices have to be within atol on *all* three coordiante axis. This means we can start looking at the first coordiante, compare that and, if it is within tolerance, we can continue with the second and third if needed. Hence, we can sort the first coordiantes (if equal then go by the second, etc.). This approach can be used, as we did, to implement a fast algorithm that only needs to check the previous vertex for equality since it is the closest yet tested vertex, at least on the first coordinate.\n",

    "\n",
    "The algorithm starts from $a$ and checks against $b$. They are close so it identifies $a$ and $b$ with coordinates of $a$. But then $a$ and $c$ are not close so they are not the same (w.r.t. the program) even though $b$ and $c$ might have been closer to eachother than $a$ and $b$. We hence can have non-optimal identifications for vertices which, again, is a trade-off that is made for increased computational efficiency.\n",

The deviating numbers of vertices could become an issue if we were to use both approach alongside eachother, which we are not. The upper triangle matrix was an early, naive approach to solve the problem for a small number of vertices where the $O(n^2)$ didn't affect the computational time significantly. It will be completely replaced by the sort approach as the used timsort is better on average and in the worst-case with $O(n\\log n)$ and equal in the best-cast (linear). Also, timsort is a stable sorting algorithm that means the eevn if we had points that are exactly the same the order in which they are mentioned would be kept so there are no differences if applied at different times."
